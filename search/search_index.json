If you don't have it, download and install it. This is the preferred IDE for MWSE modding.</p> <p>Once you have VSCode open, click File -&gt; Open Folder..., then navigate to <code>Morrowind\\Data Files\\MWSE</code>, and select the folder. You will be asked, \"Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?\" Click \"Yes, I trust the authors\". </p> <p>If you don't already have the Lua and vscode-lua-format extensions installed, you'll see popups at the bottom left corner of the screen asking you to install them. Install both of them. </p> <p></p> <p>Next, we'll save this as workspace. Click File -&gt; Save Workspace As... Save.</p> <p>Now, we are going to create the folder for our MWSE mod. On the left side of the screen, we have the folders within the <code>MWSE</code> folder. Mods usually go under the <code>mods</code> folder. Expand that folder. So long as your mod has a <code>main.lua</code>, you can put it anywhere within the <code>mods</code> folder. However, we will use the <code>mods/modderName/modName</code> naming convention. This avoids conflicting files and keeps everything tidy.</p> <p>For example, in this mod, the path of main.lua will be <code>MWSE/mods/Amalie/craftableBandage/main.lua</code>.</p> <p>You can name your folders any way you want, we used camelCase, that is, no separator between words, first letter lowercased, and the first letter of all other words capitalized. But you can use snake_case <code>craftable_bandage</code> or Normal <code>Craftable Bandage</code>. Just remember, don't put a dot in your folder name. Do not do this <code>craftable.bandage</code>, for example.</p>"},{"location":"1_introduction/#comments","title":"Comments","text":"<p>Before we do any coding, let's learn about how to comment in Lua first. Oftentimes, you want to add information about the mod and its author at the top of the script.</p> <p>When Lua code is run, comments will be skipped. Any line starting with a double dash <code>--</code> is considered a comment. This is a single line of comment.</p> <pre><code>-- Mod: Craftable Bandage\n</code></pre> <p>You can also do multi-line comment with <code>--[[]]</code>. That is, double dash followed by two opening brackets with two closing brackets following the comment. Let's add some information about our mod. </p> <pre><code>--[[\n    Mod: Craftable Bandage\n    Author: Amalie\n\n    This mod allows you to craft OAAB bandages with novice bushcrafting skill.\n    It serves as an alternative to alchemy and restoration.\n]]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"1_introduction/#variables","title":"Variables","text":"<p>Now let's learn how to create a variable in Lua. A variable holds some type of data which can be manipulated and referred to. This mod is Craftable Bandage, so we will create a local variable called <code>bandageId</code> and set it to the id of one of the OAAB bandages.</p> <pre><code>local bandageId = \"AB_alc_HealBandage02\"\n</code></pre> <p>In Lua, variables are global by default but you probably don't want that most of the time. The <code>local</code> here specifies that this is a local variable, as opposed to a global variable.</p> <p><code>bandageId</code> is the variable name. </p> <p>The equal symbol <code>=</code> is the assignment operator and we're assigning a string to <code>bandageId</code>. A string is a collection of characters like <code>AB_alc_HealBandage02</code> and it is enclosed in double or single quotation marks. </p> <p>One thing you'll notice is that you don't need to put a semicolon <code>;</code> at the end of each line in Lua. </p>"},{"location":"1_introduction/#functions","title":"Functions","text":"<p>Let's move on to functions. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. Let's define an empty function called <code>registerBushcraftingRecipe</code>.</p> <pre><code>local function registerBushcraftingRecipe()\n\nend\n</code></pre> <p>If you are following along the tutorial, you can see in the IDE, both the function and the variable we just created are greyed out. Hovering over it, it tells us that they are unused function and unused local. That's because we haven't called them or used them anywhere in the script yet. Let's do that now.</p> <p>To call a function, type the name of the function followed by a pair of parentheses.</p> <pre><code>registerBushcraftingRecipe()\n</code></pre> <p>Right now, when the function is called, it's not doing anything. So let's use this function to print some information to MWSE.log.</p> <pre><code>mwse.log(\"[Craftable Bandage] Registering bushcrafting recipe...\")\n</code></pre> <p>This is one of the most common ways to write information to MWSE.log and we will look at another way (a better way) to do logging later. For now, let's run Morrowind.exe and check the log. You should be able to see <code>[Craftable Bandage] registering bushcrafting recipe...</code> in the log. </p> <p>MWSE.log can hold lots of useful information for modders if they know how to read and write it. The line starts with <code>[Craftable Bandage]</code> is the line our script wrote. Lines starts with <code>[Crafting Framework]</code> and <code>[Ashfall]</code> are the lines Crafting Framework (CF) and Ashfall wrote. Our line printed before CF implies that our function was run before CF and Ashfall started running. </p> <p>But we want to register the bandage recipe when CF is registering bushcrafting recipes. How do we do that? Well, let's learn about event-driven programming. </p>"},{"location":"1_introduction/#event-driven-programming","title":"Event-Driven Programming","text":"<p>In event-driven programming, or event-based programming, events are \"fired\" when an action takes place. Your code listens for them and handles them accordingly. You can look up all the events MWSE provides here.</p> <p>Let's look at the <code>initialized</code> event. This fires when game code has finished initializing, and all masters and plugins have been loaded. Let's copy the example code provided in the document page and paste it in our main.lua.</p> <pre><code>--- @param e initializedEventData\nlocal function initializedCallback(e)\nend\nevent.register(tes3.event.initialized, initializedCallback)\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>tes3.event.initialized</code> is the event name and <code>initializedCallback</code> is the function to call when <code>initialized</code> event is fired. Same as before let's write some information to print out to MWSE.log.</p> <pre><code>mwse.log(\"[Craftable Bandage] Initialized\")\n</code></pre> <p>Usually, you want to register your mod's events inside <code>initializedCallback</code>. And in our case, we need to register the <code>\"Ashfall:ActivateBushcrafting:Registered\"</code> event and <code>registerBushcraftingRecipe()</code> will be the event callback function.</p> <pre><code>event.register(\"Ashfall:ActivateBushcrafting:Registered\", registerBushcraftingRecipe)\n</code></pre> <p>What this means is when Ashfall is registering their bushcrafting recipes, our <code>registerBushcraftingRecipe()</code> function will run. So let's test this. Launch the game and read the MWSE.log. </p> <p>If we search the log for \"Bandage\", you'll could only find the <code>\"Initialized\"</code> log but not the <code>\"registering recipe\"</code> log. That's because, the print order of the logs, you know that our mod was initialized after Crafting Framework finished registering all the MenuActivator. That's why our event callback never runs. </p> <p>We can fix this by tweaking the <code>priority</code> when registering our <code>initialized</code> event. </p> <pre><code>event.register(tes3.event.initialized, initializedCallback, { priority = 100 })\n</code></pre> <p>Functions registered with higher <code>priority</code> will run first. The default is 0. Setting the <code>priority</code> to be anything higher than 0 can make sure our <code>initializedCallback</code> will run before The Crafting Framework registered all of the recipes. </p> <p>Launch the game again. Now you should be able to see in your log that our bandage recipe was registered right when The Crafting Framework was registering Ashfall's Bushcrafting MenuActivator.</p> <p>That's it for today. You've learned how to comment, how to create variables and functions, and the concept of event-driven programming.

It plays the bandaging sound instead of the potion drinking sound. We can take a look at how they do it in <code>\\OAAB\\MiscPotions\\main.lua</code>.</p> <p>Studying other people's scripts is a great way for beginners to learn how to mod with MWSE-Lua. </p> <p>All the MWSE-Lua code ever published on Nexusmods can be found at mwse-lua-dump. If you don't know how to use certain functions or certain events, you can look it up by search the dump. Very very handy!</p> <p>Back to OAAB_Data and the <code>MiscPotions</code> script:</p> <pre><code>-- Prevent drink sounds\nlocal function stopDrinkSounds(e)\n    if not e.item.id:find(\"^AB_alc_\") then return end\n\n    addBlockedSound(e.reference, \"drink\")\n    event.trigger(\"OAAB:equip\", e)\nend\nevent.register(\"equip\", stopDrinkSounds, {priority = 1000})\n</code></pre> <p>It registers the <code>equip</code> event with very high priority to ensure it runs first. Then it checks if the <code>item</code> that's being equipped here has an <code>id</code> that starts with <code>\"AB_alc_\"</code>. The caret symbol <code>^</code> here anchors the pattern at the beginning of the string.</p> <p>Then it calls the <code>addBlockedSound()</code> function to block the drink sound from playing. Then it triggers an event called <code>\"OAAB:equip\"</code> with <code>e</code> as the event data, which is the <code>equipEventData</code>. </p> <p>Next, let's look at another script from OAAB_Data, <code>\\OAAB\\Bandages\\main.lua</code>. This is the script we are gonna base our script on. </p> <pre><code>local function bandageEquipEvent(e)\n    if (e.item.id:find(\"^AB_alc_HealBandage\")) then\n        tes3.playSound({\n            reference = e.reference,\n            sound = \"AB_Bandaging\"\n        })\n    end\nend\nevent.register(\"OAAB:equip\", bandageEquipEvent)\n</code></pre> <p>It registers the aforementioned <code>\"OAAB:equip\"</code> event instead of <code>equip</code>. This is to make sure that the script from <code>MiscPotions</code> runs first. Then it checks if the item being equipped has an <code>id</code> that starts with <code>\"AB_alc_HealBandage\"</code>. If so, play the <code>\"AB_Bandaging\"</code> sound. </p>"},{"location":"4_adding_bandage_features/#adding-our-own-features","title":"Adding Our Own Features","text":"<p>We're going to write a script that's based on this logic to implement two features for bandages.</p> <p>First, we'll get rid of the magical visual effect when using a bandage. </p> <p>Second, we'll make the duration of the healing effect vary according to your character's Survival skill. So, if your skill is at level 20, it heals for 20 seconds; and if your skill is at 40, it heals for 40 seconds.</p> <p>Before we continue, it's important to mention that you should always give credit to any source you use. Here, we're copying from Greatness7's script, and before we are using Merlord's script. Most MWSE-Lua modders are generally okay about other modders using their scripts but there are exceptions. Ask them if you can. Most MWSE-Lua modders hang out at either Morrowind Modding Community or The Dahrk Realm. \"Be excellent to each other.\"</p> <p>We will copy the above script to our main.lua.</p> <p>Instead of <code>playSound</code>, we want to block the magical visual effect from playing. We can do that simply by blocking the event and applying the magical effect ourselves.</p> <p>To block an event, return <code>false</code>. Then, to apply the magical effect, we use the <code>applyMagicSource()</code> function from the <code>tes3</code> API. Here we pass a table of magic effects to mimic the vanilla behaviour. </p> <pre><code>---@param e equipEventData\nlocal function bandageEquipEvent(e)\n    if (e.item.id:find(\"^AB_alc_HealBandage\")) then\n        tes3.applyMagicSource({\n            reference = e.reference,\n            name = \"Bandage\",\n            effects = {\n                {\n                    id = tes3.effect.restoreHealth,\n                    duration = 30,\n                    min = 1,\n                    max = 1,\n                },\n            },\n        })\n        return false\n    end\nend\n</code></pre> <p>We also need to remove the bandage, once it is consumed. Here we need to put <code>removeItem()</code> inside <code>timer.delayOneFrame()</code>. Otherwise, the game will crash. </p> <p>The default timer type for <code>delayOneFrame()</code> is <code>simulate</code> time, a timer that will not advance in menu mode. However, if we want the bandage to be removed immediately after we use it, we need to set it to <code>timer.real</code>, a timer that advances at real time. </p> <pre><code>        })\n        timer.delayOneFrame(function()\n            tes3.removeItem({\n                reference = e.reference,\n                item = e.item,\n                playSound = false,\n            })\n        end, timer.real)\n        return false\n</code></pre> <p>Also, it's nice to have a message popup saying \"Bandage applied\" if the user is the player. </p> <pre><code>        end, timer.real)\n        if e.reference == tes3.player then\n            tes3.messageBox(\"Bandage applied\")\n        end\n        return false\n</code></pre> <p>Now, if we test it in-game and we use the bandage, it won't play the vfx. That's the first feature done. Next, we want the duration of the effect to vary depending on your character's survival skill. </p> <p>Let's create two variables <code>bandageEffect</code> an <code>duration</code> and use it in the table of effects we pass in the <code>applyMagicSource()</code> function. The <code>bandageEffect</code> needs to be defined outside function <code>registerBushcraftingRecipe(e)</code>, as we need to use it later. Assign string <code>\"Bandage\"</code> to the variable. Then we'll create a function called <code>getEffectDuration()</code> that accepts <code>e.reference</code> as the argument and returns the duration to the <code>duration</code> variable. </p> <pre><code>local bandageEffect = \"Bandage\"\n\n---@param ref tes3reference\n---@return integer duration\nlocal function getEffectDuration(ref)\n    local duration\n    return duration\nend\n...\n    if (e.item.id:find(\"^AB_alc_HealBandage\")) then\n        local duration = getEffectDuration(e.reference)\n        tes3.applyMagicSource({\n            reference = e.reference,\n            name = bandageEffect,\n            effects = {\n                {\n                    id = tes3.effect.restoreHealth,\n                    duration = duration,\n                    min = 1,\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we need to add our logic in the <code>getEffectDuration()</code> function so the duration varies. Since only the player has Skills Module skills, we want this survival-based duration feature to only affect the player. </p> <pre><code>local function getEffectDuration(ref)\n    local duration\n    if ref == tes3.player then\n\n        return duration\n    else\n        return 30\n    end\nend\n</code></pre> <p>We can get the player's survival skill using the <code>getSkill()</code> function in Skills Module. We use the <code>clamp()</code> function from the <code>math</code> library to clamp the skill level between 20 and 40, then assign it to the return value <code>duration</code>.</p> <pre><code>    if ref == tes3.player then\n        local skillLevel = skillModule.getSkill(\"Ashfall:Survival\").value\n        duration = math.clamp(skillLevel, 20, 40)\n        return duration\n    else\n</code></pre> <p>Now, if our character is level 30 in Survival, the effect should last for 30 seconds. And if it's level 100, the duration will be clamped at 40 seconds. </p> <p>One final feature we'll add is stopping the healing effect if the bandage user gets hit while it's active. To do that, we need to register both the <code>damaged</code> and <code>damagedHandToHand</code> events. We'll name the callback <code>removeBandageHealing</code>. </p> <pre><code>---@param e damagedEventData|damagedHandToHandEventData\nlocal function removeBandageHealing(e)\n\nend\n...\n    event.register(\"OAAB:equip\", bandageEquipEvent)\n    event.register(\"damaged\", removeBandageHealing)\n    event.register(\"damagedHandToHand\", removeBandageHealing)\n    log:info(\"Initialized\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"4_adding_bandage_features/#loops","title":"Loops","text":"<p>We want the healing effect to stop when someone is damaged. First, we need to figure out if the <code>reference</code> is using the bandage when damaged. We can find that out by looping through the <code>activeMagicEffectList</code> of <code>e.reference.mobile</code>. </p> <p>Hovering over <code>activeMagicEffectList</code>, it says it is of type <code>tes3activeMagicEffect[]</code>. The pair of brackets here means it is a list of <code>tes3activeMagicEffect</code>. </p> <p>To iterate the effects in this list, we're gonna use a <code>for</code> loop. Loop is an essential part of programming, so it's important that you know how to use them.

You can find the <code>buildnumber</code> in the first line of <code>MWSE.log</code>. It is the number after version number and before \"built\". For example, the buildnumber is <code>3238</code> if the first line is <code>Morrowind Script Extender v2.1.0-3132 (built Mar 30 2023) hooked.</code></p> <p>If your mod depends on other mods, you can specify them with <code>[dependencies.mods.\"Mod Name\"]</code>. If the mod comes with a metadata file, you can check the version with <code>version = \"^x.x.x\"</code>. If the mod doesn't come with a metadata file, you could check if a plugin or master file is installed, write <code>plugin = plugin name.esp</code>. To check if the MWSE-Lua scripts are installed, write, for example, <code>mwse-module = mer.ashfall</code>. This is checking if the folder <code>\\MWSE\\mer\\ashfall</code> is installed. <code>url</code> is where you specify where to download said mod. </p> What your Craftable Bandage-metadata.toml should look like <pre><code>[package]\nname = \"Craftable Bandage\"\nhomepage = \"https://github.com/dev-chenxing/mwse-modding-tutorial\"\nauthors = [\"Amalie\"]\nversion = \"1.0.0\"\n\n[dependencies]\nassets = [\"MWSE/mods/Amalie/craftableBandage\"]\n\n[dependencies.mwse]\nbuildnumber = 3238\n\n[dependencies.mods.\"OAAB_Data\"]\nversion = \"^2.1.9\"\nurl = \"https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042\"\n\n[dependencies.mods.\"Ashfall\"]\nversion = \"^3.10.0\"\nurl = \"https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057\"\n\n[dependencies.mods.\"The Crafting Framework\"]\nversion = \"^1.12.0\"\nurl = \"https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51009\"\n\n[dependencies.mods.\"Skills Module\"]\nmwse-module = \"OtherSkills\"\nurl = \"https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"5_metadata/#zip-up","title":"Zip Up","text":"<p>Finally, we zip up the two files in <code>Craftable Bandage.7z</code>:</p> <pre><code>.\n\u251c\u2500 MWSE/\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 mods/\n\u2502     \u2514\u2500 Amalie/\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500 craftableBandage/\n\u2502          \u2514\u2500 main.lua\n\u2514\u2500 Craftable Bandage-metadata.toml\n</code></pre> <p>That's it!
